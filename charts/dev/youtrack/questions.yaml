            If prefix queries and wildcard strings do not return all matching word forms
            in a search query, set this value to 2. Setting this system property affects the
            performance of your YouTrack server. The lower the value, the slower
            the performance of your server.

            Sets the amount of time YouTrack waits to compile changes that are applied to an issue
            as a digest before sending an email notification, in milliseconds. Reducing this value
            increases the rate at which YouTrack analyzes notifications and can have a negative
            impact on general server performance. Increasing this value from the default (one minute)
            can reduce the overall number of notification emails that are sent by YouTrack.

            Lets you run the YouTrack service without connecting to other services inside your network.
            When true, YouTrack doesn't generate notifications, update webhooks, retrieve email messages
            for Mailbox integrations, or send HTTP requests for workflows. This can be particularly helpful
            for staging environments where you want to test new functionality without disrupting users
            who are working with the live application.
