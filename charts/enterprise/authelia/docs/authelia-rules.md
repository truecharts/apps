# Authelia Rules

This is a collection of some common Authelia Rules.

:::note[RULE ORDER]

It is important that rules are created in the correct order in Authelia. Rules are processed from top to bottom with the first matching rule being applied. The most narrow rules should be applied first with the most broad rules last.

:::

All rules requiring Authelia authentication were configured with `two_factor` (2FA). If you do not want 2FA on some or all rules replace the Policy with `one_factor`
