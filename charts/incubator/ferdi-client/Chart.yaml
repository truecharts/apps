description:
  Ferdi is a destkop app that helps you organize how you use your favourite
  apps by combining them into one application. It is based on Franz - a software already
  used by thousands of people - with the difference that Ferdi gives you many additional
  features and doesn't restrict its usage! Ferdi is compatible with your existing
  Franz account so you can continue right where you left off.
