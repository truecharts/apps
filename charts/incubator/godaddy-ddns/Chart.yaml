description:
  Chart to provide a DDNS service for godaddy domains. Uses the GoDaddy
  REST API to update the given domain's DNS IP address to the public IP address of
  the host it is executing on. Performs a check every 10 minutes, but you can alter
  this if you like by modifying /etc/cron.d/godaddy-ddns inside the Chart.
