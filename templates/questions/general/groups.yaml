      Configured the images to be used for the Chart.
      It's wise to use "digest pinned" tags and to avoid using "latest".

    description: |
      These settings configure how the actual Pods and containers are running.
      Generally, on SCALE, we only expose a limited subset of these settings for the primary workload and container.
      
      More info on workload options can be found here: https://truecharts.org/common/workload/
      Whereas the container options can be found here: https://truecharts.org/common/container/
    
    
  - name: App Configuration
    description: |
       Every application has different values that may be required to run or have multiple options that the user may choose to enable or disable to change the behavior of the application.
       Most options should have a Tooltip (Circled Question Mark) to further describe said option.
       
       More information can be found by looking up the chart-specifc docs on the website: https://truecharts.org/charts/description-list/
    
    
  - name: Services
    description: |
      Service and Networking options for any applications are contained here. 
      Some applications may have complicated networking setups with multiple options or some may have no options here at all. 
      
      Options here include the service and port configurations for the application, and more may be enabled or changed under the Advanced Settings and Show Expert Config boxes.
