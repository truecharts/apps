      Configured the images to be used for the Chart.
      It's wise to use "digest pinned" tags and to avoid using "latest".

    description: |
      For TrueNAS SCALE We've grouped a number of settings here, that all effact how apps run in general.
      More info can be found on their respective pages in manual:
        - Global Settings https://truecharts.org/common/global/
        - TimeZone https://truecharts.org/common/#tz
        - Pod Options https://truecharts.org/common/podoptions/
        - Image Pull Secrets
    
    
  - name: Workload
    description: |
      These settings configure how the actual Pods and containers are running.
      Generally, on SCALE, we only expose a limited subset of these settings for the primary workload and container.
      
      More info on workload options can be found here: https://truecharts.org/common/workload/
      Whereas the container options can be found here: https://truecharts.org/common/container/
    
    
  - name: App Configuration
    description: |
       Every application has different values that may be required to run or have multiple options that the user may choose to enable or disable to change the behavior of the application.
       Most options should have a Tooltip (Circled Question Mark) to further describe said option.
       
       More information can be found by looking up the chart-specifc docs on the website: https://truecharts.org/charts/description-list/
    
    
  - name: Services
    description: |
      Service and Networking options for any applications are contained here. 
      Some applications may have complicated networking setups with multiple options or some may have no options here at all. 
      
      Options here include the service and port configurations for the application, and more may be enabled or changed under the Advanced Settings and Show Expert Config boxes.
      
      Information the Kubernetes service options can be found here: https://truecharts.org/common/service/
      
  - name: Networking
    description: |
      Contains advanced networking options that are not actively supported by the TrueCharts team.
      
      Currently only contains scaleExternalInterfaces.
      Information for which is available here: https://truecharts.org/common/scaleexternalinterface/
    
  - name: Persistence
    description: |
      Many applications will have certain options for storage to be configurable by the user, the main two being PVC and hostpath but may include other types. 
      This storage is called Persistence since it is not deleted upon restart or upgrade of an application.
      
      For more information on the many different storage options, checkout the docs here: https://truecharts.org/common/persistence/
      
      For more information on why TrueCharts advices the use of PVC storage, please see: https://truecharts.org/general/faq/#why-pvc-is-recommended-over-hostpath
    
    
  - name: Ingress
    description: |
      Ingress (more commonly known as Reverse Proxy) settings can be configured here. This is how Kubernetes connects your Applications in containers to FQDNs (fully qualified domain names). 
      If you choose to enable this you must have a "Ingress Provider" aka "Reverse Proxy" installed (We highly advice Traefik: https://truecharts.org/charts/premium/traefik/) 
      It also requiresa DNS service to actually resolve the DNS name of the FQDN specified.
      
      More info on Ingress configuration options: https://truecharts.org/common/ingress/
      
    
  - name: SecurityContext
    description: |
      The security settings for each application and/or permissions that each application may have for the files/directories created. 
      Each application will come with predefined permissions but users may want to change certain setting depending on their usage or capabilities. 
      
      Unless necessary users are advised to keep this section mostly to defaults.
      
      For more information on security settings see: https://truecharts.org/common/securitycontext/
    
    
  - name: Resources
    description: |
      Resources limits that have been defined by each application are in this section. 
      Most will have a specific default that some users may want to change based on their specific hardware or needs.
      
      This also contains the options to mount GPUs or, more precisely, "request" GPU's to be mounted.
      
      For more information checkout: https://truecharts.org/common/resources/
    
  - name: Devices
    description: |
      These are special "mountpoints" that can be used to mount miscelanious USB and PCI devices using special hostPath mounts.
      For clearity we've decided to seperate this from persistence on SCALE.
      
      For more inforation see: https://truecharts.org/common/persistence/device/

      Things included here are VPN addons, Codeserver for editing files inside the application’s container, Netshoot for network troubelshooting, etc. 
      
      Generally not required for use but may be necessary or usefull at times for specific applications.

    description: |
      For Postgresql we use "CloudNative-PG" as a backend, which has to be installed first.

  - name: Documentation
    description: |
      We added this section to make everyone aware that OpenSource isn't always easy.
      It doesn't keep existing without signficant ongoing support, so please consider supporting TrueCharts and other OpenSource projects.
